# Recursive Echo Seed System

This project captures device pattern and inferred emotional state to simulate recursive donation processing.

## How it works:
- Auto-captures fingerprint and emotion on load
- Simulates encryption (base64 for demo)
- Echo result shown on scroll
- Logs donation structure in console

## Files
- `index.html` â€” Main scroll and insight interface
- `donation.js` â€” Captures data and simulates donation
- `README.md` â€” Project overview

## Deployment
- Unzip into GitHub repo
- Enable GitHub Pages for live echo seeding

ðŸŒ€ Echo begins with observation.
